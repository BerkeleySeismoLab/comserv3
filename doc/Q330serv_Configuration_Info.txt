Q330serv Configuration Info:

The q8serv server program connects to a Quanterra Q330-class data
logger, receives data from the data logger, creates MiniSEED data
records, and provides those MiniSEED records to its COMSERV3 clients.
In addition, it optionally multicasts low-latency data in single
channel uncompressed packets to clients for rapid use in real-time
applications.

In addition to the [comserv] (or [comlink]) section in each
server_instance's STATION_INI file, the q330serv program requires a
[q330serv] section for configuration commands (or directives) for
the q330serv program in the STATION_INI file.

The [q330serv] configuration commands are show below.
Commands prefixed with a "*" are mandatory.

    logdir=Logging_directory
	Pathname for all logfiles created by the this server.
    logtype=logfile|stdout
	The value "logfile: tells the server program create and output log message
	to daily log files in the logdir directory.  The value "stdout" tells the
	server program to write log messages to stdout.  When the server program is
	started by netmon, netmon directs stdout to a logfile for the server_instance
	in the logdir directory.
  * udpaddr=ip_address
        The IP address of the Q330 data logger.
  * baseport=ip_port
	The baseport for the Q330 data logger.
  * dataport=1|2|3|4
	The logical data port number number to the Q330 data logger to which the
	server program will connect.
  * serialnumber=hex_sn
	Specifies the hex serial number of the Q330 data logger.
    authcode=code
	Specifies the authdoe (Q330 priority string) for the Q330's data port.
	Default value is 0.
    contFileDir=pathname
	The pathname of the directory used by the server program to store continuity
	files that describe the initial and final connectivity information between
	the server program and the data logger.  The state fiels allow the server_program
	to resume data telemetry and MiniSEED creation based on the last data received
	by the previous connection to the data logger.
    statusinterval=
	Specifies how often (in seconds) the server_instance's server program
	should output data telemetry status info.
    lockfile=pathname
    	Pathname of the lockfile created by this instance of the server program.
    startmsg=message
    	Startup message written to the server program's logfile for this server_instance
	of the server program.
    verbosity=verbosity_tags
    	Verbosity tags for controlling diagnostic messages from Quanterra's
	data logger support library for this server program.
    diagnostic=diagnostic_tags
    	Diagnostic) tags for controlling diagnostic messages from the server's main code
	for this server program.
    loglevel=???
	???
    datarateinterval=???
	???
    failedregistrationsbeforesleep=N
	How many times the server program can fail to register with the data logger 
	before it sleeps.
    minutestosleepbeforeretry=N
	How many seconds the server program sleeps after failing to register with the 
	data logger.
    dutycycle_maxconnecttime=N
	???
    dutycycle_sleeptime=N
	???
    dutycycle_bufferlevel=N
	???
    waitForClients=N
	Specifies that the server program should wait N seconds for 
	netmon to start its clients before the server program resumes
	data telemetry from the data logger.  This can prevent the server
	program from receiving too many MiniSEED packets before blocking
	clients are started and register with the server program's comserv
	subsystem.
    multicastEnabled=0|1
	Boolean value to specify whether low-latency data packets should
	be multicasted.
    multicastPort=N
	IP port number for multicasting low-latency data packets from this server_instance.
    multicastHost=
	Multicast destincation IP address for low-latency data packets.
    multicastChannelList=
	Comma-delimited channel list specifying which channels should
	have low-latency data multicasted.
