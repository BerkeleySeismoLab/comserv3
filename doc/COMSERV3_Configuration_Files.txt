COMSERV3 Configuration files contains one or more sections, and each
section contains 0 or more lines of configuration commands (or
directives) per section.  A section begins with a section header line,
and continues until the next section header line or the end-of-file.
A section header line has the format:

    [section_name]

where the string within the brackets is the section name.
A section name may NOT include any whitespace.

A configuration line has the format of either
    keyword=value
or a directive specifying the pathname of a file
to be included at this point in the current config file.
    @pathname

An include file may contain all or any portion of one or more
configuration sections.  Include files can be nested up to 10
levels.

A keyword is a string with no whitespace that begins with an
alphanumeric character.  Keywords are always case insensitive.  The
value is the blank-trimmed remainader of the line after the "=" sign.
Values with blanks do NOT have to be quoted.  If the value contains
quote charaters, the quotes are considerd part of the value.  Many,
but not all Keywords values are considered case-insensitive by the
programs that read the configuration lines.  Values such as SEED
station, SEED network, server description strings, command lines, etc
may be case sensitive.

Any line that does not begin with an alphanumeric character or "[" is
treated as a comment line.  Comment lines can appear anywhere in a
configuration file, and are ignored.

The COMSERV3 system has 2 system-wide configuration files, and one
configuration file for each instance of a server program (called a
server_instance).

I.  Systemwide files:

As of comserv3.1, the two systemwide configuration files
   STATIONS_INI
   NETWORK_INI
can have their default pathnames overrided at runtime by setting and
exporting the above environment variable names.  If you use netmon,
you should set and export these variable in the netmon startup script,
and they will be used by netmon and inherited by all servers and
clients started by netmon.

1. STATIONS_INI file (default pathname is /etc/stations.ini)

The STATIONS_INI file contains 1 section for each server_instance
that provides a brief description of each server.

The mandatory server_instance configuration parameters are:

    desc=string
	Descriptive string for the server_instance.
    dir=Pathname
	Pathname of the directory containing the server_instance's station.ini file.
    source=comserv
	The value MUST be comserv (or comlink for comserv2 compatability).
    station|site=SEED_station_code
	The SEED station code in the MiniSEED data delivered by the server.
	The station and site keywords are considered equivalent keywords.
    network|net=SEED_network_code
	The SEED network code in the MiniSEED data delivered by the server.
	The network and net keyworkd are considered equivalent keywords.

The optional server-instance configuration parameters are:

    group=group_name
	The name of a group in which the server_instance should be included.
	There may be multiple group configuration commands for a single server_instance.
	Group_names are used by the netmon program to refer to a collection
	of server_instances.

Example:

    [DSNQ8.BK]
    * Q8 s/n 510614 at DSN home
    dir=/home/doug/config/stations/all/DSNQ8.BK
    desc=Q8 DSNQ8.BK 
    source=comserv
    station=DSNQ8
    network=BK
    group=primary
    group=BK
    group=q8

    [1485.XX]
    * Q330 s/n 1485 at McCone 298
    dir=/home/doug/config/stations/all/1485.XX
    desc=Q330 1485.XX
    source=comserv
    station=1485
    network=XX
    group=primary
    group=XX
    group=q330

    [CMB.BK]
    * Q330 at Columbia College, CA
    dir=/home/doug/config/stations/all/CMB.BK
    desc=Q330 CMB.BK
    source=comserv
    station=CMB
    network=BK
    group=primary
    group=BK
    group=mserv

2.  NETWORK_INIT	(default pathname is /etc/network.ini)

The NETWORK_INI file is used by the netmon control daemon that can
start, restart, and shudown server specified in the STATIONS_INI file
and managed clients specified in each servers's station.ini file.  

It contains a [netmon] section for the netmon program, and an optional
[global_defaults] section for default configuration parameters that may be
used by one or more server_instance's program.  Any configuration parameter
set in the [global_defaults] section may be overriden by a configuration
parameter line in any server_instance's STATION_INI file.

A.  The [netmon] section can contain the following configuration lines:

A.1.  The following parameters are use to control basic operations of
the netmon program.

    logdir=Logging_directory
	Pathname for all logfiles created by the netmon program.
	This include the logfile for netmon as well as the logfile
	for all program spawned by netmon.
    lockfile=pathname
    	Pathname of the lockfile created by the background netmon
    	monitoring daemon.
    cmddir=Command_dir
    	Pathname in which an interactive instance of netmon places
	command files to be executed by the netmon background daemon.
    poll_interval=N
        Netmon's polling interval (in seconds).
	This value must be >= CS_CHECK_INTERVAL defined in the file service.h.
	Netmon may increase this paramter if it is smaller than the
	CS_CHECK_INTERVAL used when compiling netmon.

A.2.  The following parameters are used to control netmon's startup
and shutdown of servers and clients.

    server_startup_delay=N
        Number of seconds that netmon allows for a server_instance program 
	to start after it has been spawned.
    client_startup_delay=N
        Number of seconds that netmon allows for a client program 
	to start after it has been spawned.
    max_shutdown_wait=N
        Number of seconds that netmon allows for client and server programs
	to shut down after they have been signaled to shut down.
    max_check_tries=N
	Maximum number of times netmon will try to check for a program to
	shut down before it will kill it "with prejudice".

A.3.  The following paramters are used to control netmon's timeout
notification for no data packets being inserted into the
server_instance's comserv storage rings.  Most networks no longer
use netmon to provide notification of data timeouts, as they have
other methods of detecting data timeouts or hith data latencies.

    notify_prog=commandline
	Program command line used to notify the operations staff about data timeouts
	for a server_instance program.  The server_instance name will be 
	added as a command line parameter when the program is run.
	If no notification is desires, specify the command "/bin/true",
	which returns a 0 return code in all cases.
    min_notify=N
	Minimum number of seconds for a timeout condition for a
	server_instance.  A timeout state is set of a server_instance
	that has not received any MiniSEED data packets in this number
	of seconds.
    re_notify=N
        How often netmon should re-notify operations staff if a
	server_instance contines stays in a timeout state.
    res_notify=0|1
        Boolean value that specified whether netmon should notify
	operations staff when a timeout condition has been cleared.

B.  The [global_defaults] section contains default parameters for one
or more server_instances.  Any parameter in this section may be
overriden by a corresponding parameter line in a server_instance's section
in its STATION_INI file.

Directives for all servers:
    logdir=logging_directory
	Directory name for the logfiles created by netmon for the
	server programs and clients started by netmon.
    logtype=logfile|stdout
	Specifies whether the server programs should create and manage
	it's own daily logfiles, or whether it should write log
	messages to stdout, which may be redirected to a single
	logfile by the netmon program.  Logfiles managed by server a
	broken into daily logfiles based on UTC days.
    contfiledir=pathname_for_continuity_state_files
        Directory name in which the server_instance's program should read and
	write continuity files.
    verbosity=N
	Specifies the level of verbosity of the comserv section of the
	server_instance. Default value is 0.  Possible values are 0, 1
	or 2, which specify increaed levels of logging.
    diagnostic=N
	Specifies the level of diagnostic logging on the server_instance.
	Currently not used?
    loglevel=comma_delimited_string
	Specifies the types of logging for the server_instance's input
	library (lib330, lib660, libmcast).  Possible values are:  
		PD for loggine packet data info, 
		RM for logging regular messages, 
		SD for logging dump info from the input library, 
		SM for logging auxmsgs,
		VB for logging other verbose info.
    statusinterval=N
	Specifies how often (in seconds) the server_instance's server program
	should output data telemetry status info.
    waitforclients=N
	Specifies in seconds how long the server_instance's server program 
	should wait after program startup for clients to be started by netmon
	before starting data telemetry from the data logger.
    packetqueusize=N
	Specifies the number of 512-byte MiniSEED packets to allocate for
	the volatile intermediate queue for buffering between the server's 
	input thread and the main thread that writes the MiniSEED packets
	to the non-volatile comserv server shared memory.
	The default value is 500.

Directives for q8serv and q330serv:
    multicastenabled=0|1
	Boolean value to specify whether low-latency data packets should
	be multicasted.
    multicasthost=224.0.0.121
	Multicast destincation IP address for low-latency data packets.
    multicastchannellist=channel_list
	Comma-delimited channel list specifying which channels should
	have low-latency data multicasted.

    dutycycle_maxconnecttime=N

    dutycycle_sleeptime=N

Directives for q8serv:
    limitbackfill=N
	Specifies the maximum number of seconds to backfill on server startup.
	Default value of 0 implies no limit on backfill.

II. Server configuration (one per server_instance):

1.  station.ini		(referred to as STATION_INI file)a

Each server_instance has a configuration file with the fixed namd
station.ini located in the unique directory defined by the
server_instance's DIR parameter in the STATIONS_INI file.

The STATION_INI file has at least 2 configuration sections.

A.  Comserv_subsystem section.  See the comserv3_subsystem configuration
that may be useful 

B.  Server_program section, based on the server_program's name.
Currently supported COMSERV3 server_program program are:
	[q330serv]
	[q8serv]
	[mserv]
See the appropriate server program configuration info file for details.

C.  Optinnal sections for each client run by netmon, as specified in the
[netmon] section of the STATION_INI file.  The client sections are
normally named according to the COMSERV3 clientname.  If there are
multiple instances of the same blocking or registerd client run by nemon for 
for a single server_instance, each client must have a unique clientname.
See the documenation file for each client.  Many clients have 
the following configuration commands:

    lockfile=lockfile_pathname
	Pathname of the lock file for this client.
	The client program is responsible for locking this file to ensure
	that multiple instances of the clent for this server_instance
	are not running simultaneously.
    pidfile=pidfile_pathname
	Pathname of the PID file for this client.
	The PID file must be created by the client.

Clients may have their own client-specific paramters specified in
their named section.
