Mserv Configuration Info:

The mserv server program reads multicasted MiniSEED records from a
specified multicast addressa and port, and provides those MiniSEED
records to its COMSERV3 clients.

In addition to the [comserv] (or [comlink]) section in each
server_instance's STATION_INI file, the mserv program requires an
[mserv] section for configuration commands (or directives) for
the mserv program in the STATION_INI file.

The [mserv] configuration commands shown below.
Commands prefixed with a "*" are mandatory.

    logdir=Logging_directory
	Pathname for all logfiles created by the this server.
    logtype=logfile|stdout
	The value "logfile: tells the server program create and output log message
	to daily log files in the logdir directory.  The value "stdout" tells the
	server program to write log messages to stdout.  When the server program is
	started by netmon, netmon directs stdout to a logfile for the server_instance
	in the logdir directory.
  * mcastif=ip_address
        The IP address of the network interface used to read multicasted MiniSEED
	records.
  * udpaddr=multicast_address
        The multicast IP address used by mserv to read multicasted MiniSEED records.
  * ipport=N
    	The UPD port number used by mserv to read multicasted MiniSEED records.
    statusinterval=
	Specifies how often (in seconds) the server_instance's server program
	should output data telemetry status info.
    lockfile=pathname
    	Pathname of the lockfile created by this instance of the server program.
    startmsg=message
    	Startup message written to the server program's logfile for this server_instance
	of the server program.
    verbosity=verbosity_tags
    	Verbosity tags for controlling diagnostic messages from Quanterra's
	data logger support library for this server program.
    diagnostic=diagnostic_tags
    	Diagnostic) tags for controlling diagnostic messages from the server's main code
	for this server program.
    loglevel=???
	???
    waitForClients=N
	Specifies that the server program should wait N seconds for
	netmon to start its clients before the server program resumes
	reading multicasted MiniSEED records.  This can prevent the
	server program from receiving too many MiniSEED packets before
	blocking clients are started and register with the server
	program's comserv subsystem.
