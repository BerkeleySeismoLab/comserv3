The configuration parameters for the comserv subsystem is contained
in each server_instance's STATION_INI file.  The name of the section
([comserv] or [comlink]) is the value of the "source" directive in
the server_instance's section of the STATIONS_INI file.

The [comserv] (or [comlink]) directive are:
    segid=N
	Shared memory ID for the server's comserv shared memory segment.
	This must be a unique shared memory id among all server_instances
	on the system.
    station=SEED_station_name
	The SEED station code in the MiniSEED data delivered by the server.
    verbosity=0|1|2
	Verbosity setting for diagnostic messages from the comserv code.
    pollusec=N
    	How often the comserv server subsystem in microsecions should poll
	its clients.  Recommended values is 200000.  The lower the number,
	the more CPU will be be used by the server_instance program.
    databufs=N
    	Number of MiniSEED records in the comserv queue for DATA records.
    detbufs=N
    	Number of MiniSEED records in the comserv queue for EVENT DETECTION records.
    timbufs=N
    	Number of MiniSEED records in the comserv queue for Timing (ACE) records.
    calbufs=N
    	Number of MiniSEED records in the comserv queue for Calibration records.
    msgbufs=N
    	Number of MiniSEED records in the comserv queue for LOG records.
    blkbufs=N
    	Number of MiniSEED records in the comserv queue for Opaque Data records
	(XML station configuration records for q8serv, binary configuration records
	for q330serv).
  A numbered client directive for each client managed by netmon:
    clientN=clientname[,blocking_timeout]
	Definition for client N (there can be 1 to 16 client).  The
	value is the client name, and optionally a blocking time which
	defines the client as a blocking client.  Client names must be
	unique among all clients for this server_instance.  If the
	client is a blocking client, then the blocking_time is the
	number of second that the comserv_system will hold a record in
	an attempt to deliver it to the client.  If any of the queues
	for the MiniSEED records get filled due to the inability to
	deliver the record to the client, the server may either stop
	receiving data from the data logger, or discard any new record
	for that queue until there is space in the queue.
    uidN=uid
        Not currently used.
