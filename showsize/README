The showsize program illustrates why it is required to use the compiler flag
	-DUSE_GCC_PACKING 
which applies the C/C++ attribute
       __attribute__ ((__packed__))
to some variables and datatypes.

The server libraries 
	lib330
	lib660 
	libmsmcast (for consistency)
AND the servers
	q330serv
	q8serv
	mserv (for consistency)
MUST be compiled with this compiler option to properly function with
the remote data loggers.  

If the libraries and servers are not compiled with this flag, some
data objects in the libraries used for communicating with the remote
data loggers will have incorrect sizes.  This can affect the offset of
objects within structures, and the overall size of structures.

Since Quanterra wrote and supports the lib330 and lib660 libraries,
and their libraries require this compiler, you must use this option when
compiling code that communicated with these libraries.
This includes the code for all comserv3 server programs:
	q330serv
	q8serv
	mserv
