    1.	Updated fnmatch.c to correspond with Solaris and POSIX versions.
	Return code of 0 means match now, not non-match.
	Updated cpick_card_server.c and evtalarm.c which use fnmatch.
    2.	Updated datalog_utils to perform pattern match on the ...LIMIT
	channel names.  Now the following config directive should work.
		DATA_LIMIT=12H,HL?,HH?
