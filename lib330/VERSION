Source code from lib330	version 2015/09/30.
Updated on 2023/02/28 to incorporate:
	Fix to libclient.c/loadpinginfo() from BSL.
	Changes from ISTI (mostly const added so some types).
	Changes to resolve all -Wall compilation warnings/errors.
	Fixes and debugging info for TCP support:
	      still does not work well due to Q330 limited buffering.
