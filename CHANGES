Initial release of the COMSERV3 system, an enhancement and ugprade
to the original Quanterra COMSERV system and user_contributed
COMSERV2 updates.

1.  Changed the original COMSERV client-server protocol from 4 char 
client_name and station_name fields to 32 char client and server_named 
strings (31 char plus null-termination). The COMSERV3 server_name used
for each instance of a server program is now completely decoupled from 
the SEED station name of the data from the data logger. In order to make
each server_name unique and descriptive, you may choose to include the
SEED network code and SEED station name (or some varient of it) in the
server_name.  Examples are:
	CMB.BK
	BK.CMB
	CMB_BK
	BK_CMB
or for sites that have multiple data loggers that generate data with
the same SEED name, you may use more complicated names, eg:
	CI_PASC
	CI_PASC_20
	CI_PASC2
	CI_PASC_2
This string is now referred to a the server_name rather than the 
station_name, since it uniquely identifies an instance of one
of the server programs.

2.  Since the server_name is no longer directly tied to the SEED station 
name, the following directives MUST be provided in each server_name section
in the STATIONS_INI file
	NET=seed_network_code
	SITE=seed_station_code
or	STATION=seed_station_code 
Examples are:
	STATION=CMB
	NET=BK
The full 5 character SEED station names is now supported.

3.  Now that client names are no longer limited to 4 characters,
the default client_names have now been changed to be the same
as the program name.  New client names are:
	netmon
	datalog
	sl2mcast
	cs2ringserver
	datasock
	cs2mcast
	csstat
and the programs will look for sections in the server_program's
STATION_INI file with these names.

4.  Deprecated the original comserv server program (aka comlink),
since the dataloggers it supported (Quanterra Q680/Q4120/Q730 systems)
are obsolete and are no longer operational.

5.  Renamed the qmaserv (or qmaserv2) server program to q330serv to
more accurately reflect its purpose.

6.  Added q8serv server program to support Quanterra Qantix Q8 data loggers.

7.  For each server program (mserv, q330serv, q8serv), created a 
config section in each server_name's STATION_INI file for parameters
specifc to that server program that are NOT related to the the COMSERV3
client/server subsystem.  The config sections are named the same as the programs:
	[mserv]
	[q330serv]
	[q8serv]

8.  Created the [global_defaults] section in NETWORK_INI file.
All server program (or netmon client) now read at the [global_defaults] 
section for default parameter setting that may be overridden
by settings in the server section of the station file (or the netmon,
the [netmon] section in the NETWORK_INI file).

9.  Moved the following server program config directives from the 
NETWORK_INI file's [netmon] section to the [global_defaults] section 
in NETWORK_INI file:
	LOGDIR
	LOGTYPE
	MULTICASTENABLED
	MULTICASTHOST
	MULTICASTPORT	
	MULTICASTCHANNELLIST
The parameters
	LOGDIR
	LOGTYPE
may still be specified in the the [netmon] section of
The netmon program has been changed to also first look in the 
section [global_defaults] for the directives
	LOGDIR
	LOGTYPE
These parametes may be

10.  Added the following server program directives to the [global_defaults] section:
	CONTFILEDIR
	STATUSINTERVAL
	WAITFORCLIENTS
These directives may be overridden in the program section of each
server_name's STATION_INI file.

11.  Changed the name of the [COMLINK] section in the each server_name's 
STATION_INI file to [COMSERV] to reflect that it contains information for the
COMSERV3 client/server subsystem.  Removed all deprecated config directives
that were for only for the  Quanterra Q680/Q4120/Q730 systems
communication or command-and-control protocol with those dataloggers.
For backwards compatability, the [COMLINK] section name is still 
supported as a synonym for [COMSERV] section name.

12.  All server program now read the [global_defaults] section in the NETWORK_INI
for program parameters that can be applied to any instance of the server program.
These parameters can then be overridden by parameter settings in the
program's section of the STATION_INI file for the specific server_name.
Note that the order of precedence has changed from older COMSERV distributions,
where the global info in the NETWORK_INI fie overrode configuration parameters
in the STATION_INI files.
