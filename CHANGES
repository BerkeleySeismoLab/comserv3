COMSERV3 changes:

=========================================================================================

Release 1.1.0

1.  Added the ability for environment variables to overrirde the default pathnames
of the 2 global COMSERV3 config files:
   STATIONS_INI - override default pathname of /etc/stations.ini
   NETWORK_INI  - override default pathname of /etc/network.ini
Note that all servers and clients should reference the same files.
All servers and clients were updated to use these variable if they are set.
IRIS incorporated the critical patches for libslink into libslink-2.7.0RC.
Their version of the library can now be used.

2.  Reduced CS_CHECK_INTERVAL to 2 to improve netmon response on server and client timeouts.
If this causes problems when running many servers, you can increase the value.
NOTE THAT CHANGING THIS VALUE REQUIRES RECOMPILATION OF ALL COMSERV3 LIBRARIES,
SERVERS, AND CLIENTS.

3. Added TCP support for q330serv.  However, current Q330 tcp support appears to be
buggy, so this is NOT recommended.
Fixed bug in lib330 that prevented Q330 TCP support from running.
Added debugging code for lib330 PB loglevel, and additional debugging code
for TCP support.

4. Misc other bugs fixed.

Release 1.0.1

1.  Updated to Quanterra lib660-r65.  
Incorporated BSL addition/modifications with conditional compilation.
2.  Incorporated IRIS libslink-2.6/develop with 2 critical patches.

Release 1.0.0

1. Updated multiple programs to ensure that any config_struc structures is initialized
to all zeros before initial use.  Required due to comserv3 changes that allow
calls to open_cfg() with different config_struc structures in order to allow multiple
config files to be open concurrently (eg stations.ini, network.ini, station.ini files).
2. Added missing lockfile directive to [q8serv] section of station.ini.
Server lockfile directives are now in the server-specific sections rather than
the common [comserv] (aka [comlink] section.
3. Changed PacketQueue.C to disable enable debugging output.
4. Changed cs2mcast and csstat to disable command line debugging output.
5. Updated help and debugging output from various programs.
6. Update run_netmon script to rotate netmon logfile.
7. Misc other changes, such as ensuring various clients now support both the
pidfile and lockfile directives.

Initial beta release of the COMSERV3 system, an enhancement and ugprade
to the original Quanterra COMSERV system and user_contributed
COMSERV2 updates.

1.  Changed the original COMSERV client-server protocol from 4 char
client_name and 4 char station_name fields to 32 char client and 32
char server_named strings (31 char plus null-termination). 
NOTE:  THIS MEANS THAT YOU SHOULD NOT MIX COMSERV3 AND COMSERV2
PROGRAMS ON THE SAME SYSTEM, SINCE THE MEMORY STRUCTURES FOR CLIENT-SERVER
COMMUNICATION HAVE CHANGED.

The COMSERV3 server_name used for each instance of a server program is now
completely decoupled from the SEED station name of the data from the
data logger. In order to make each server_name unique and descriptive,
you may choose to include the SEED network code and SEED station name
(or some varient of it) in the server_name.  Examples are:
	CMB.BK
	BK.CMB
	CMB_BK
	BK_CMB
or for sites that have multiple data loggers that generate data with
the same SEED name, you may use more complicated names, eg:
	CI_PASC
	CI_PASC_20
	CI_PASC2
	CI_PASC_2
This string is now referred to a the server_name rather than the 
station_name, since it uniquely identifies an instance of one
of the server programs.

2.  Since the server_name is no longer directly tied to the SEED station 
name, the following directives MUST be provided in each server_name section
in the STATIONS_INI file
	NET=seed_network_code
or	NETWORK=seed_network_code
	SITE=seed_station_code
or	STATION=seed_station_code 
Examples are:
	STATION=CMB
	NETWORK=BK
The full 5 character SEED station names is now supported.

3.  Now that client names are no longer limited to 4 characters,
the default client_names have now been changed to be the same
as the program name.  New client names are:
	netmon
	datalog
	sl2mcast
	cs2ringserver
	datasock
	cs2mcast
	csstat
and the programs will look for sections in the server_program's
STATION_INI file with these names.

4.  Deprecated the original comserv server program (aka comlink),
and UCB client cpick_card_server and evtalarm since the dataloggers
they supported (Quanterra Q680/Q4120/Q730 systems) are obsolete and 
are no longer operational.  Source code for each of these is still 
provided for reference for reference.  The source codes for the
deprecated programs have been updated to compile with the current 
COMSERV3 include files and libraries.

5.  Renamed the Q330 server program qmaserv (or qmaserv2) to q330serv to
more accurately reflect its purpose.

6.  Added q8serv server program to support Quanterra Qantix Q8 data loggers.

7.  For each server program (mserv, q330serv, q8serv), created a 
config section in each server_name's STATION_INI file for parameters
specifc to that server program that are NOT related to the the COMSERV3
client/server subsystem.  The config sections are named the same as the programs:
	[mserv]
	[q330serv]
	[q8serv]

8.  Created the [global_defaults] section in NETWORK_INI file.
All server programs (and netmon client) now read at the [global_defaults] 
section for default parameter setting that may be overridden
by settings in the server section of the station file (or the netmon,
the [netmon] section in the NETWORK_INI file).

9.  Moved the following globally-used server program config directives
from the NETWORK_INI file's [netmon] section to the [global_defaults]
section in NETWORK_INI file:
	LOGDIR
	LOGTYPE
	MULTICASTENABLED
	MULTICASTHOST
	MULTICASTPORT	
	MULTICASTCHANNELLIST
The parameters
	LOGDIR
	LOGTYPE
may still be specified in the the [netmon] section of the NETWORK_INI
file to allow netmon to override the setting in the [global_defaults].
The netmon program has been changed to also first look in the 
section [global_defaults] for the directives
	LOGDIR
	LOGTYPE
These directives (for netmon) may be override in the [netmon] program
section of the NETWORK_INI file.

10.  Added the following server program directives to the [global_defaults] section:
	CONTFILEDIR
	STATUSINTERVAL
	WAITFORCLIENTS
These directives may be overridden in the program section of each
server_name's STATION_INI file.

11.  Changed the name of the [COMLINK] section in the each server_name's 
STATION_INI file to [COMSERV] to reflect that it contains information for the
COMSERV3 client/server subsystem.  Removed all deprecated config directives
that were for only for the  Quanterra Q680/Q4120/Q730 systems
communication or command-and-control protocol with those dataloggers.
For backwards compatability, the [COMLINK] section name is still 
supported as a synonym for [COMSERV] section name.

12.  All server program now read the [global_defaults] section in the NETWORK_INI
for program parameters that can be applied to any instance of the server program.
These parameters can then be overridden by parameter settings in the
program's section of the STATION_INI file for the specific server_name.
Note that the order of precedence has changed from the COMSERV2 distribution,
where the global info in the NETWORK_INI file overrode configuration parameters
in the STATION_INI files.
